# Password Checker ðŸ”’
This is my first Git project so I am just trying to learn the ropes.
This is a simple Python script that checks if a password has been compromised using the Have I Been Pwned API.

## Features
Checks passwords against a public database of leaked passwords  
Provides security recommendations  
Simple and easy to use  

## How to Use
1. Install Python 3  
2. Run the script:  
   ```sh
   python password_checker.py
3. Enter password to check its security.
